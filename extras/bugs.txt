1. This part of code in autoMove() ->
	int index = 0;
	cout<<"dieNumbers length = "<<dieNumbers.size()<<endl;
	for( auto currentRoll : dieNumbers ){	//Outer loop iterates through the gotis
		if(currentRoll > 6) {
			cout<<"Accessed at "<<tries<<". CurrentRoll is "<<currentRoll<<". And, dieNumbers[tries] = "<<dieNumbers.at(tries)<<endl;
			for(auto i : dieNumbers) cout<<i<<' ';	//To print the vector, for debug purposes
			endGame("Iterator invalidated, or DieNumbers corrupt");
		}
		++index;
		.
		.
		.

	BUG-> Even though, the dieNumbers vector is not being updated inside the actual loop, PLUS, i am using range for, even then the 'currentRoll' got at next position, doesnt even seem to belong to the dieNumbers vector.
	I Added that 'index' variable, working as the 'index' of the 'currentRoll' i get, to verify if the dieNumbers vector has been tampered with, but the output shows that dieNumbers seems to be fine, but the currentRoll is not.
	Output->
		`Accessed at 2. CurrentRoll is 21847. And, dieNumbers[tries] = 2
		6 6 2 2 `
		//The '6 6 2 2' is the vector itself
