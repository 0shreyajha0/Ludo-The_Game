## Ludo - The Game (Help)

First, 'a fun run', start ludo, and type "Robot" in Player 1 and Player 2, then see :D


After building (maybe installed too), run the ludo (or ludo.exe).

Firstly, you have to type in the player names. (Note there are hidden surprises 😁, Read more ahead)

The colours are this (clockwise starting from Red) ->
Player 1 - Red     (Bottom Left)
Player 2 - Green
Player 3 - Yellow
Player 4 - Blue

Leave the name empty, if that colour/player isn't playing

Type "Robot" (case in-sentitive) for random moving robot (choses goti to move at random).
Type "Jai Hind" for THINKER robot (or any other string, you can chose in includes/keywords.hpp)
