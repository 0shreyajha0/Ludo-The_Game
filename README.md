# Ludo - The Game v2.0

Ludo, our popular Indian board game, completely implemented in C++

<img src=./extras/ludoScreen.png
raw=true alt=‚ÄúScreenShot‚Äù>

_Ask any doubts in the #[Discussions](https://github.com/adi-g15/Ludo-The_Game/discussions) :D_

## Features

* Easy and Powerful **customisability** *(More in developer notes)*
* **Variable number of inputs** at all input fields
* **Shortcuts, Keywords, _Cheat codes_**
* **Two robot modes** -
  * RandomRobo
  * ThinkerRobo (it will chose the best possible move at a time, from almost 30-90 possibilities)
* Display **adaptive** to width of screen
* Memory-safe (using smart\_pointers, and uncounted for 'new' statements)
* **Multi-threaded** (for ThinkerRobo execution)
* **0 dependencies** outside stdc++  (for coloured output support, agauniyal.github.io/rang/ is utilised and included as a header rang.hpp)
* Plus all basic ludo game features, and my own *custom* keywords _(you can create yours too :D )_

## Building

> On Linux & Windows -

```sh
mkdir build -p
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

> After building you will have a `ludo.exe` inside build/ (Linux) or build/{Debug,Release} (Windows), that's your executable üòÉ

### Installation

> On Arch, simply run 'makepkg -si', the PKGBUILD file will handle rest

After #Building, run `cmake --install .`

## READING THE CODE

> You **DON'T** need to understand 'all' code to understand this program
>
> **Discussion**: If you can't understand something, simply ask that in 'Discussion' section, let's grow together !, we will reply :D

1. Even though, the codebase may seem big, or confusing, you should see the "name of the functions" that gets called inside these, in this order -

    * main.cpp
    * board.cpp::Init\_Game()
    * board.cpp::play()

2. I think only seeing the names of functions calls in these, you would get the workflow of this(the functions have been named such)... then if you want, see the `includes` directory first, and for how the function is implemented, see `src`.

3. `//!` or `/**/` -> This syntax for comments has been used for giving info of the code.

> The whole structure of the code is such that most things can be easily changed, to be able to show effect elsewehere too, some of which for eg.
>
>
> * To change **Order of Gameplay**, you only need to change one vector, ie. `colourOrder<>`
>
> * Different **Players can be bound to different gotis**, as you want, just update the `colourMap` and `playerMap`
>
> * To change **Number of Gotis**, just update the `goti_per_user`, and _internally_ it just got implemented! No fuss
>
> * And, for display on output : In the updateDisplay(), may use if conditions to add an additional type2() row, for each +2 gotis of goti_per_user
>
> * In most apps, even if you get a 6, you have to decide your move then, but at our _gaon_, we could proceed to roll the die, till its not 6, YOU can opt any of those ways, for that, replace `dieNumbers<>` to a single integer!
>
> * Many more if when you search (yaar please consider point 1, if that's the case :-)

## Contribution -

Start an issue for whatever feature you believe should be good here.

And, in case you want to be a contributer here, and work on it together, do ask.

Do sugggest any other feature you would like, i do claim the codebase to be quite modular, and easily customisable (It was what i used to think earlier, it IS modular enough to understand, i am not modifying it now, so as to keep it more original when i made it).
